# Proof Of Gamer Hood

Whatâ€™s the problem?
Online platforms in both Web2 and Web3 are being overrun by bots, leading to several critical issues:

- Spam and Scams: Bots flood platforms with unwanted messages and fraudulent schemes.
- Disinformation and Manipulation: They spread false information and manipulate public opinion.
- Reduced User Trust: The prevalence of bots erodes trust among genuine users.
- Distorted Metrics: Bots create misleading data, affecting the accuracy of platform analytics.
- Security Risks: They pose significant security threats.
- Exploitation of Tokenomics: Bots exploit the economic models of blockchain projects.
- Invasion of Privacy: They invade users' privacy.
- Disruption of Communities: Bots disrupt the functioning and harmony of online communities.
Addressing these issues is crucial to maintaining the integrity, security, and trustworthiness of online platforms.

How does PROOF OF GAMERHOOD solve this issue?
Implement a bot counter mechanism that requires users to prove they are human by playing a randomized (AI-unfriendly) mini-game during the signup process. Upon successful completion, users are issued a non-transferable ERC-721 token with a randomized expiry date.

This solution yields the following benefits:

High entry Barriers for Bots
Token is Reuseable on any (d)apps
No biometrics compromised
Extendable with proof of machine hood
Evolvable into a SDK
Multiple Business Model Options

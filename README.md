# Proof Of Gamer Hood

This project uses mini games to protect defi apps from bots 
We use collection of minigames to verify the user's identity and to prevent bots from accessing the app
the games are randomized and change also individual game will have different color schemes to confuse bots utilizing computer vision

once user beats a captcah game he is given a soulbound nft token which will be used for subsequent logins
the token has an expire date and can be refreshed by dapp admins

We use this repo for the nft soulbound contract
the contract is deployed on sepolia at the following address: 

sepolia address: `0x125bC6b7Df7a909e55b80B533E5Bdd12Dc320253`

The dapp implementing the capctah game and this token can be found at the following link:
